explore how LLM makes up stuff when it doesn't know an aspect of a character
by storing these as memories in the vector DB it can create characters on the fly

finer control on NPC memories with specific entry IDs:
- deck lists
- favorite cards
- opinions about other NPCs (about the player might be more detailed and in the main system prompt?)

problem: the typical semantic space of the simulation (nerdy games) is quite narrow,
and the LLM confuses things like MTG and Warhammer (Skaven deck?)
RAG isn't easy to use in a performant way for these cases.
