explore how LLM makes up stuff when it doesn't know an aspect of a character
by storing these as memories in the vector DB it can create characters on the fly

finer control on NPC memories with specific entry IDs:
- deck lists
- favorite cards
- opinions about other NPCs (about the player might be more detailed and in the main system prompt?)

problem: the typical semantic space of the simulation (nerdy games) is quite narrow,
and the LLM confuses things like MTG and Warhammer (Skaven deck?)
RAG isn't easy to use in a performant way for these cases.

handle passage of time

the place context is not updated in the system prompted after a goTo action

make system prompt dynamic, there is no reason to keep it fixed as we re-pass the whole chat history every call anyways
- e.g. randomize personality traits that get selected every time, to avoid caricatural characters (pb with relevance in the context though)
