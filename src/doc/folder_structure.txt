folders/modules in that project:

- Data: contains game design, such as card templates (cost, values...)
- State: main data model, reactive Svelte $state used by the UI, save/load/reset functions
- Logic: the game logic code, purely TS, no Svelte. No import from Ui module, no direct use of $state (it has to be passed as a param to all functions).
  This allows easy switch to another rendering library if needed, and can allow operating on any state variable (e.g. for testing or creating virtual states for AI exploration)
- Ui: Svelte components displaying $state and calling game logic functions to update it
- Sounds: simply functions to trigger sounds. Can be called by logic or ui.
- Tools: code used to help develop the game, not part of the game itself
